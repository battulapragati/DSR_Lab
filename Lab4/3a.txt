Q)Create  a matrix object from the data  that is given in the above question
Make a List using the plant names from above as an object to include in the list along with the original data.

matrixbee=matrix(data=c(10,1,37,5,12,8,3,9,6,4,18,9,12,4,6,8,27,6,32,23,12,13,16,9,10),nrow=5,ncol=5)
matrixbee
plantnames=list("Thistle","Vipers","GoldenRain","Yellowalfala","blackberry")
plantframe=as.data.frame(plantnames)
str(plantframe)
plantmatrix=as.matrix(plantframe)
str(plantmatrix)
rownames(matrixbee)=plantmatrix
matrixbee
class(matrixbee)
